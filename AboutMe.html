     <p>Nice to meet you! If you came here to learn a little more about me, then you're in the right place.</p>
    
    <h2 class="center">Favorite Color</h2>
    <p>If you couldn't tell already by the theme of this website, my favorite color is blue, specifically navy blue.</p>
    
    <h2 class="center">Favorite Food</h2>
    <p>My favorite food is tempura and I order it whenever I can but a close second would have to be strawberries, which I've loved since I was a kid.</p>

    <h2 class="center">Favorite Season</h2>
    <p>Fall is my favorite season because it's when my birthday is but also because I love the color of the leaves as it gets cooler. I also like the spring for its crisp mornings blooming flowers.</p>

    <h2 class="center">Favorite Video Game</h2>
    <p>At the moment, Call of Duty: Warzone is my favorite video game and I play it most days after I'm finished with school work for the day. </p>
